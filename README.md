# NoseBook

NoseBook is a Facebook clone that I have made as a final project for my full stack web development course. It has the core functionalities that Facebook has, which includes uploading posts, commenting on posts, liking a post/comment, sending/accepting friend requests, real time messaging, and real time notification system for posts, messages, friend requests, and a wide range of other features.
